# Racket Problem Sheet  
> Module: Theory of Algorithms  
> Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin 

This section of the repo is for problems that we must solve using racket, the problem sheet is set for us to use as pratice for the final problem sheet we will have that will be going towards 30% of our final grade. There are fifteen problems that we have to solve:

### 1. Re-write the following, evaluate using a Racket interpreter/complier  
**(A)** (3 x (5 + (10 ÷ 5)))  
**(B)** (2 + 3 + 4 + 5)  
**(C)** (1 + (5 + (2 + (10 ÷ 3))))  
**(D)** (1 + (5 + (2 + (10 ÷ 3.0)))  
**(E)** (3 + 5) x (10 ÷ 2)  
**(F)** (3 + 5) x (10 ÷ 2) + (1 + (5 + (2 + (10 ÷ 3))))

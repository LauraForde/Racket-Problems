# Racket-Problems  
> Module: Theory of Algorithms  
> Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin 

This repo will contain a number of solutions to problems our lecturer has set out for us to complete in our own time to assist with our study for this module. The list of problems are in the "Racket Problem Sheet" pdf file that is in this repo. To complete these problems we are to use Racket.

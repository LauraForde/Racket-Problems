# Problem Sheets  
> Module: Theory of Algorithms  
> Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin 

This repo will contain a number of different sections for each problem sheet that I will complete. The solutions to these problem sheets will not be going towards my final grade for this module but to be used as a study tool for the final problem sheet that will be worth 30% of my final grade. For each new problem sheet I will create a new folder that will contain the PDF of the problems we are given and my solutions.  

So far I only have one section:
